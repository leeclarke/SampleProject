# Signal Encryption Lib tests.

A quick test using the Signal Protocol package [signalapp/libsignal-protocol-java](https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-java)

This demos how to encrypt Alice's message to Bob etc. with running code. Nothing special but, it's nice to have a working sample around to see how the parts come together!
